## Project Description

The main goal for this project is to implement an automatic transliteration system that can

convert a proper noun from English to Russian. Two examples are given below.

In this case, the Russian word for Russia’s capital city is transliterated.

        Москва - Moskva (Moscow)

Whereas here I have transliterated my own name into its Cyrillic equivalent.

        Kieron - Кыйрон

I believe that the users of this piece of software will be language learners. Most likely native

Russian speakers who are learning English or native English speakers who are learning

Russian.
