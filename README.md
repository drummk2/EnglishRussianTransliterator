# EnglishRussianTransliterator

A Linux-based statistical machine transliteration system that can transliterate a proper noun from the English Roman alphabet to the Russian Cyrillic alphabet. 

The training of both the language and translation models was done with the use of an external system called Moses, as was the decoding process.

All data gathering and cleaning was done with the use of Python and the Scrapy framework. 

Lastly, the graphical user interface was implemented in Python using the Tkinter library.
