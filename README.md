## Project Description

This is an automatic transliteration system that can

convert a proper noun from English to Russian. Two examples are given below.

In this case, the Russian word for Russia’s capital city is transliterated.

        Москва - Moskva (Moscow)

Whereas here I have transliterated my own name into its Cyrillic equivalent.

        Kieron - Кыйрон

I believe that the users of this piece of software will be language learners. Most likely native

Russian speakers who are learning English or native English speakers who are learning

Russian.

Note: This system is targeted towards Linux users.
