How To Transliterate
====================
- If you wish to transliterate something from English into Russian, simply
type your message into the first box with the message 'Enter English Here'
beside it. Then press the 'Transliterate' button or the Enter key and the 
transliteration process will begin.
- Due to some complexity issues, this process will take about 45 seconds to
complete. once this process has finished, you will be presented with the
Russian transliteration of your message in the other textbox.
- Also, if you ever wish to clear both textboxes, just press the 'Clear'
button or use the Ctrl-c shortcut and it will be done for you.
